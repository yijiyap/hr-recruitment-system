For easier maintenance sake, this will be a very basic frontend.

Note to the next intern: hope you enjoy building a nicer interface :p.

I will be using tailwindcdss so that there's no random classes and you can tell what the css class is doing just by the class name.
I will also be using bootstrap to speed up the development.
To prevent tailwind and bootstrap classes from clashing, I have changed the config of tailwind such that there is a need to prefix each tailwind class with "tw-". The code can be found on the `script` portion of each `.html` file.
